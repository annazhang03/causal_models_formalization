  * Causality and Semantic Separation
  *
  * This repository consists of four main modules:
  *   - Utils:          foundational definitions and helper lemmas for lists, logic, and type theory.
  *   - DAGs:           formalization of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in Rocq.
  *   - CausalDiagrams: extensions of DAGs to causal settings.
  *   - Semantics:      development of the semantic perspective on causal models.
  *
  * The main result is an equivalence proof between d-separation and the novel semantic separation,
  * The definition of semantic separation is in Semantics/SemanticSeparationDef.v.
  * The equivalence proof is completed in Semantics/SemanticAndDSeparationEquiv.v.
